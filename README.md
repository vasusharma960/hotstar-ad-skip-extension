<b>LOGIC IMPLEMENTED</b>
<br>
Whenever an ad comes in the middle of a video, there is a button which appears having the content as "Go Ads Free".
<br>
On clicking this button, it takes you to the payments page.
<br>
On the payments page, if we go try to go back, the current ad goes away.

<br><br>
The above steps are implemented in the script of this extension to skip the Ads whenever they come in the middle of a video.
